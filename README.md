# Codes and dataset developed for MSING055 final project
We collected multiple layers of Amazon product and review data to identify fake reviews. In this repo you will find two notebooks that contain Python code to do:
1. Cleaning data: the data we get from scraping aren't yet ready to be analyzed, so we did several data cleaning steps
2. Generate new attributes for analysis: two new attributes, sentiment_score and most_rev, were generated to do more in-depth analysis

In addition, in `final_dataset` folder, you will find the cleaned final dataset for further analysis.
